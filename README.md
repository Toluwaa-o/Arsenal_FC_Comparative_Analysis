# Comparative Analysis: Arsenal FC

### Completed using: Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI

In this project, i webscraped Arsenal's data for the 2022/23 season and the 2023/24 season from [FBREF](https://fbref.com/). Then i used python to clean them before exporting them to a csv file. After exporting it, i renamed some rows in excel and then i imported it into my SQL database. While it was in my SQL database, i asked a few questioned and queried the data to help answer those questions and ncover patterns and anomalies. After doing that, i visualized my findings with power bi and created a report.
